# Catalaix Knowledge Graph

This repository contains the demo for the Catalaix knowledge graph (KG).

It contains the following manually curated artifacts:

1. the [reactions](curation/reactions.tsv) including the substrates, products, and
   literature references describing the reactions
2. the [reactions hierarchy](curation/reaction_hierarchy.tsv) which connects reactions
   with different levels of abstraction
3. the [conditions](curation/conditions.tsv) including experimental information like the
   catalyst/microbe, byproducts, conditions and provenance information like the
   group that ran the reactions and literature references where the conditions
   were used
4. the [labs](curation/labs.tsv) within the consortium

Later:

1. link labs to the papers they've published, what they like to read, who they
   cite, and who cites them
